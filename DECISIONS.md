# Architecture Decision Records

ADR format: **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**.
All decisions are `ACCEPTED` unless noted.

---

## ADR-001: Use C# + .NET 8 + WPF

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** WinForge is a Windows-only desktop tool with a rich graphical
  interface for image customization.
- **Decision:** Build with C# on .NET 8 using WPF for the desktop UI.
- **Consequences:** Native Windows integration, long-term support from
  Microsoft, and a mature XAML UI stack. Requires the .NET 8 runtime/SDK on the
  dev and target machines.

## ADR-002: Use MVVM

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** The UI needs to stay testable and separated from business logic
  as features grow.
- **Decision:** Adopt the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.
- **Consequences:** ViewModels are unit-testable; UI and logic are decoupled.
  Adds some boilerplate (bindings, commands).

## ADR-003: Separate App / Core / Infrastructure

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** Platform APIs (DISM, registry, ISO) are easy to leak into the UI
  and make testing hard.
- **Decision:** Three runtime projects — App (UI), Core (domain + interfaces),
  Infrastructure (Windows implementations) — plus WinForge.Core.Tests.
- **Consequences:** Clear layering and testability; Core stays platform-agnostic
  and depends on nothing but itself.

## ADR-004: Microsoft original Windows ISO as supported input

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** The product must start from a trustworthy, unmodified source.
- **Decision:** Officially support original Microsoft Windows 11 ISO images as
  input. Third-party modified ISOs are NOT official compatibility targets.
- **Consequences:** Predictable, documented behavior; avoids distributing or
  relying on modified images.

## ADR-005: Use documented Microsoft deployment mechanisms

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** Image operations are sensitive and must be reliable and
  supportable.
- **Decision:** Prefer documented Microsoft deployment APIs/tooling (DISM,
  Windows ADK, supported PowerShell modules) wherever practical.
- **Consequences:** Lower risk of breakage across Windows updates; easier to
  support and audit.

## ADR-006: Independent implementation, no copying

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** Several Windows customization/debloat projects exist (e.g.
  tiny11builder). Reusing their code/structure would create licensing and
  originality problems.
- **Decision:** WinForge is implemented independently. Do not copy source code,
  file structure, PowerShell, function/variable names, README, XML, assets, or
  implementation approaches from tiny11builder or other debloat projects.
- **Consequences:** Full ownership of the codebase; must design our own
  approach using public Microsoft documentation.

## ADR-007: Presets are configuration data

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** Users want quick starting points (Recommended, Windows 10
  Inspired, Gaming, Privacy, Minimal, Custom).
- **Decision:** Presets are configuration data consumed by the Build Plan, not
  separate hard-coded execution paths.
- **Consequences:** Adding/changing a preset is a data change, not a code
  branch; prevents divergence and bugs.

## ADR-008: Safety and recoverability first

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** Image customization can render a system unbootable.
- **Decision:** Safety and recoverability take priority over maximum debloating.
- **Consequences:** Defaults favor stability; operations support validation,
  logging, dry-run, and rollback (Phase 11).

## ADR-009: Windows 10 Inspired uses native policies only

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** The "Windows 10 Inspired" experience is popular but risks pulling
  in third-party shell replacements.
- **Decision:** The Windows 10 Inspired experience must prefer native Windows
  policies/settings and must NOT silently bundle third-party shell-replacement
  software.
- **Consequences:** Safer, more supportable result; stays within documented
  Windows behavior.

## ADR-010: Composition root uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** The App needs a small, clear way to wire view models and services
  without a service-locator anti-pattern.
- **Decision:** Use `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` for the composition
  root (`Bootstrapper`). View models are injected directly into `MainViewModel`;
  Core interfaces are bound to Infrastructure implementations here. Core itself
  never references the DI container.
- **Consequences:** A tiny, official Microsoft dependency; explicit and
  testable wiring. No service-locator calls scattered through the UI.

## ADR-011: MVVM base lives in the App (WPF) project, not Core

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** `RelayCommand` / `AsyncRelayCommand` implement
  `System.Windows.Input.ICommand`, which is only available in a WPF-aware
  project. Core must stay platform-agnostic (net8.0, no WPF reference).
- **Decision:** `ViewModelBase`, `RelayCommand`, and `AsyncRelayCommand` are
  implemented in `WinForge.App` (net8.0-windows). Core remains free of any WPF
  dependency and exposes only `INotifyPropertyChanged`-based state.
- **Consequences:** Core stays unit-testable without WPF; command types bind
  natively to WPF controls. View models remain in the App project.

## ADR-012: Default logging is an in-memory ring buffer

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** The app needs logs visible live in the UI without a heavy
  third-party logging framework.
- **Decision:** Provide `ILoggerService` in Core and implement an in-memory,
  bounded (`ObservableCollection`-backed) logger in Infrastructure
  (`InMemoryLoggerService`). File/ETW sinks can replace it later without
  touching Core or the UI.
- **Consequences:** No external logging dependency; live Logs page works
  out of the box. Entries are capped to avoid unbounded memory use.

## ADR-013: Headless boot test verifies startup wiring

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Context:** WinForge is a WPF app; CI/sandboxes have no display, so the
  window cannot be rendered there. "The app starts" must still be verifiable.
- **Decision:** Add `WinForge.App.Tests` with a headless integration test that
  builds the real DI container, resolves the navigation shell, navigates between
  pages, mutates `AppState`, and asserts logging works — without creating a
  window.
- **Consequences:** Repeatable proof that startup wiring is correct in
  headless environments; the actual WPF window is confirmed by a developer on a
  Windows desktop.
